## Marketo
Marketo is a web platform that connects farmers and users together, allowing users to purchase products directly from the farms. The platform is built with Ruby on Rails, and is designed to streamline the purchasing process for both farmers and users.

## Features
1. User registration and authentication: Users can create an account and log in to the platform to view products and make purchases. Farmers can also create accounts to list their products and manage their inventory.
2. Product listings: Farmers can create listings for their products, including images, descriptions, and pricing information. Users can browse products and add them to their cart for purchase.
3. Shopping cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and checkout when they're ready to make a purchase. The platform uses Stripe for payment processing.


## Technology Stack
Marketo is built with Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework for building scalable web applications. The platform uses PostgreSQL for data storage, and Stripe for payment processing. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses Bootstrap for styling.
